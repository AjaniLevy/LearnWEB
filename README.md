# FEW 1.1 - Semantic Markup Practice

Learn Semantic HTML by marking up these documents. 

## What is this? 

This is a directory of text documents that you can mark up for practice learning HTML. The documents contain the typical types of things you might see in web sites on your phone and desktop. Only the text is included here! Your practice is to add the HTML tags.

As long as your syntax is valid the documents will work in a browser. That said there are some answers that are more right than others and other answers that confuse or muddle what the document is trying to express. If the markup you add is adding clarity to the content you're doing well!

**Your goal** is to mark up the document with the tags that best describe the content text. You want the tags to best express the message and intent of the content of each document.

**Don't** worry about what the documents look like in the browser. _This is a common beginner mistake_. The default styles in the browser are only default choices provided when no other stylesheet has been included. 

Use these tags: 

- Sectional tags
    - Header `<header>`
    - Section `<section>`
    - Article `<article>`
    - Footer `<footer>`
- Headings h1-6 `<h1>`
- Paragraphs `<p>`
- small `<small>`
- BlockQuote `<blockquote>`
- pre `<pre>`
- code `<code>`
- Inline tags
    - strong `<strong>`
    - emphasis `<em>`
    - abbreviation `<abbr>`
    - anchor `<a>`
    - time `<time>`
    - Superscript `<sup>`
    - quote `<q>`

## Getting started!

**tl;dr** download this repo and start adding HTML tags to each of the documents. 

This repo contains a list of challenges and solutions. Each of the solution files is marked. 

The challenge file contains only text, no markup, you will add markup.
